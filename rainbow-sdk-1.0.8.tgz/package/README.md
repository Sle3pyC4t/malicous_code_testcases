## Rainbow developper account

Your need a Rainbow **developer** account in order to use the Rainbow SDK for Node.js.

Please contact the Rainbow [support](mailto:support@openrainbow.com) team if you need one.

Notice: This is not a SDK for Bot as this SDK needs a Rainbow developer account. Nevertheless, once started, the connection to Rainbow is never broken so it can be seen as a **"always on"** user (a user that is always connected and 'online').
